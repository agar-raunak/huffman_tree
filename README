Running Instructions:
-read_tree(tree_stream)-loads the tree from the tree_stream using pickle
						module and then returns this tree.

-decode_byte(tree,bitreader)- This function finds the leaf of the tree using
						bitreader and returns back this leaf.

-decompress(compressed,uncompressed)- Uses the compressed file obj. to load
						the tree and also create an instance of bitreader. 
						uncompressed file object is passed as an argument
						for the bitwriter where the leaves of the tree are
						written to uncompressed.

-write_tree(tree,tree_stream)- This function dumps the tree to the tree_stream
						using pickle module.

-compress(tree,uncompressed,compressed)- writes tree to the compressed file
						obj. and creates an instance of bitreader using
						uncompressed and bitwriter using compressed. 
						Reads through the uncompressed file till the end,
						while simultaneously writing the byte to compressed.
						When the file has been read completely, it also
						writes down the position for the end of the file.
